# Internationalization (i18n) Guide

This guide explains how to add new language support to the SSH Tunnel Manager web panel.

## How to Add a New Language

### Step 1: Create Language Resource File

1. Navigate to the `web/static/locales/` directory

2. Create a new JSON file named with the language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French, `de.json` for German)

3. Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all the values

### Step 2: Language File Structure

The language file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "title": "Your translation here",
    "name": "Your translation here",
    "help_title": "Your translation here"
  },
  "navigation": {
    "help": "Your translation here",
    "docker_hub": "Docker Hub",
    "github": "GitHub",
    "back": "Your translation here"
  }
  // ... continue with all sections
}
```

### Step 3: Update Language Support

1. Open `web/static/i18n.js`

2. Find the `getSupportedLanguages()` method

3. Add your language to the array:

```javascript
getSupportedLanguages() {
    return [
        { code: 'en', name: 'English' },
        { code: 'zh', name: '中文' },
        { code: 'fr', name: 'Français' }, // Add your language here
        // ... other languages
    ];
}
```

4. Update the language validation in the `switchLanguage()` method:

```javascript
if (!["en", "zh", "fr"].includes(lang)) {
  // Add your language code here
  console.error(`Unsupported language: ${lang}`);
  return false;
}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Translation

1. Start the application

2. Use the language toggle button to switch to your new language

3. Verify that all text is properly translated

4. Check both the main page and help page

## Translation Guidelines

### Consistency

Use consistent terminology throughout the translation. Create a glossary of key terms if needed.

### Context

Consider the context in which text appears:

- **Buttons**: Keep text short and action-oriented
- **Labels**: Be descriptive but concise
- **Messages**: Provide clear feedback to users
- **Help text**: Be thorough and helpful

### Length

Keep translations reasonably similar in length to avoid UI layout issues. If a translation is significantly longer, consider:

- Using abbreviations
- Rephrasing for brevity
- Testing the UI to ensure it still looks good

### Technical Terms

Some technical terms should remain in English:

- SSH
- Docker
- YAML
- API
- CLI
- Hash

### Placeholders

Preserve placeholder formats in your translations:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "tunnel_started": "Tunnel {{name}} started successfully"
  }
}
```

The `{{name}}` placeholder must remain unchanged.

## Common Translation Keys

| Key Pattern | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `app.*` | Application titles and names |
| `navigation.*` | Navigation elements and links |
| `table.*` | Table headers, placeholders, and content |
| `buttons.*` | Button labels and tooltips |
| `messages.*` | User feedback messages |
| `validation.*` | Form validation error messages |
| `help.*` | Help documentation content |

## Currently Supported Languages

| Language | Code | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| English | en | Complete |
| 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese) | zh | Complete |
| 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese) | zh-hant | Complete |
| 日本語 (Japanese) | ja | Complete |
| 한국어 (Korean) | ko | Complete |
| Español (Spanish) | es | Complete |
| Français (French) | fr | Complete |
| Русский (Russian) | ru | Complete |
| العربية (Arabic) | ar | Complete |

## Submitting Your Translation

1. Fork the repository

2. Create a new branch for your translation:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-german-translation
   ```

3. Add your language file to `web/static/locales/`

4. Update `web/static/i18n.js` to include your language

5. Test your translation thoroughly

6. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description of the language added
   - Confirmation that all strings are translated
   - Any notes about translation choices

## Testing Translations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] All text on main page is translated
- [ ] All text on help page is translated
- [ ] Button tooltips are translated
- [ ] Error messages are translated
- [ ] Success messages are translated
- [ ] Placeholder text is translated
- [ ] Language persists after page refresh
- [ ] No layout issues with translated text

### Browser Testing

Test in multiple browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Mobile Testing

Verify translations display correctly on mobile devices.

## Updating Existing Translations

If you find errors or want to improve existing translations:

1. Edit the appropriate language file in `web/static/locales/`

2. Test your changes

3. Submit a pull request with a description of what was changed and why
